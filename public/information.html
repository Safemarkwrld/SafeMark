      <h4>Why SafeMark was launched?</h4>
      <p>SafeMark was born out of a simple but urgent realization: in a world flooded with products,
        services, and information, trust has become one of the scarcest resources.
        <br>
        People needed a way to quickly identify what's genuine, safe, and worth their time 
        — without sifting through endless reviews, conflicting opinions, or misleading claims.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our founders saw the frustration in everyday choices — from buying items online to verifying service providers 
        — and decided to create a mark that could be earned, not just displayed. SafeMark became that seal of credibility: 
        a visible promise that what you're seeing has been checked, verified, and meets a standard you can rely on.
        Launched with the belief that trust should be transparent, SafeMark empowers people to make confident decisions, 
        while motivating creators, sellers, and service providers to uphold higher standards. It's not just a badge 
        — it's a commitment to safety, authenticity, and peace of mind.

      <h3>Purpose of SafeMark</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        SafeMark was created to build <b>trust and safety</b> in online transactions, especially in peer-to-peer marketplaces. 
        Too often, buyers fear losing money on products they haven't seen, while sellers risk shipping goods without secure payment.

        SafeMark acts as a secure middle layer that ensures:
        <li>Buyers' payments are safely held until they confirm satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Sellers are protected by upfront deposits and verified proof of payment.</li>
        <li>Disputes are minimized through transparent processes such as the <b>Test Product First option.</b></li>

        The purpose of SafeMark is simple: empower buyers with freedom of choice while giving sellers peace of mind. 
        <b>It makes online transactions safer, more transparent, and more reliable for both parties.</b>

      <h3>How does the SafeMark Marketplace work?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>SafeMark is a trust-first marketplace where every transaction is secured through verification, deposits, 
        and fair review processes. Here's how it works:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. Browse & Select Products</b>  
        Buyers explore products listed by verified sellers.
        <br>
        <b>2. Choose a Purchase Option</b>  
        <i>Direct Purchase</i> - Pay 100% upfront through SafeMark's secure system.
        <br>
        <i>Test Product First</i> - Deposit at least 50% of the price, receive the product, and test it for up to 2 days. 
        If the product is not preferred, the buyer receives a refund of their deposit minus delivery fees.
        <br>
        <b>3. Secure Proof of Payment (PoP)</b>
        Buyers upload proof of payment, which is reviewed and confirmed by SafeMark before the order progresses.
        <br>
        <b>4. Seller Protection & Delivery</b>
        Sellers only ship once payment has been verified. This ensures sellers are protected against fraud or fake orders.
        <br>
        <b>5. Buyer Review & Confirmation</b>
        <li>If the buyer is satisfied, they confirm and SafeMark releases payment to the seller.</li>
        <li>If not, the Test Product refund policy applies, protecting both buyer and seller.</li>
      </p>

      <h3>SafeMark, Test Product Feature</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The Test Product First option is designed to give buyers peace of mind when purchasing high-value items. 
        Instead of paying the full amount upfront, buyers can secure their order with a 50% deposit.

        <b>Buyers then receive the product and have 2 full days to review and test it.</b>
        <li>If they decide not to keep the product, the deposit is refunded minus delivery costs.</li>
        <li>If they choose to keep it, the remaining balance must be paid to complete the purchase.</li>

        This approach provides buyers with the freedom to make confident decisions while ensuring sellers are protected with a deposit against misuse.
      </p>

    <div class="information-card" id="ootc">
      <h3>SafeMark Official Ownership Transfer Certificate</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Upon completing your purchase, SafeMark immediately issues an <b>Official Ownership Transfer Certificate to the buyer.</b> 
        This certificate serves as legal proof of ownership for the purchased product, confirming that the buyer is the legitimate owner.
        Key points:
        <br>
        <b>Authenticity Guaranteed:</b> Each certificate is uniquely issued and verifiable, ensuring the transaction is officially recognized.
        <br>
        <b>Manufacturer Registration:</b> The certificate allows buyers to update the product's registration with the manufacturer, protecting warranties and support rights.
        <br>
        <b>Secure & Transparent:</b> SafeMark's certification process ensures that ownership transfer is securely documented, reducing the risk of fraud.
        <br>
        Easy Reference: Keep the certificate for your records — it is accepted as official proof in any ownership-related inquiries or claims.

      <h3>Binance Payment Method</h3>
      <br>
      <p>SafeMark supports Binance Pay as one of its trusted payment methods, allowing buyers and sellers to transact quickly, securely, and globally.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. Instant & Secure</b>
        Binance Pay offers real-time transfers with end-to-end security — no need to worry about bank delays or third-party risks.
        <br>
        <b>2. Low-Cost & Borderless</b>
        Payments can be made from anywhere in the world with minimal transaction fees, making it ideal for cross-border trade.
        <br>
        <b>4. Proof of Payment (PoP)</b>
        After sending payment through Binance Pay, buyers upload the transaction proof on SafeMark to trigger review and order confirmation.
        <br>
        <b>5. Buyer & Seller Protection</b>
        Funds are only recognized after SafeMark verifies the transaction.
        This ensures sellers don't ship without verified payment, and buyers don't risk sending money without tracking.
